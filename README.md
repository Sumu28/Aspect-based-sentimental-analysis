# ModernBERT Multidomain ABSA README

## Project Overview

This project implements a **Multidomain Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)** pipeline using **ModernBERT** for educational review datasets.

The project compares:

* Multidomain learning
* Cross-domain learning
* Weighted vs non-weighted loss
* Different learning rates
* Different epoch configurations

The evaluation framework includes:

* Shared fixed test sets
* Row-level prediction tracking using `row_id`
* Domain-wise evaluation
* Error analysis
* Neutral sentiment analysis
* Multidomain vs cross-domain disagreement analysis

# Dataset Structure

The project uses three educational review datasets:

| Dataset                   | Description               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `course_balanced.csv`     | Course review dataset     |
| `teacher_balanced.csv`    | Teacher review dataset    |
| `university_balanced.csv` | University review dataset |

Each dataset contains:

* `review`
* `aspect`
* `sentiment`
* `domain`

# Required Packages

Install the following packages before running the notebook.

```python
pip install transformers
pip install datasets
pip install accelerate
pip install scikit-learn
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install torch
```

Recommended environment:

* Python 3.10+
* CUDA-enabled GPU
* Google Colab GPU runtime preferred

---

# Model Used

The project uses:

```python
answerdotai/ModernBERT-base
```

Imported using:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification
```

---

# Notebook Workflow

## 1. Import Libraries

The notebook imports:

* pandas
* numpy
* torch
* sklearn
* transformers
* datasets
* matplotlib

Random seeds are fixed for reproducibility.

---

## 2. Mount Google Drive

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

---

## 3. Load Datasets

Datasets are loaded from Google Drive.

Example:

```python
course_df = pd.read_csv(
    "/content/drive/MyDrive/ABSA/course_balanced.csv"
)
```

---

## 4. Create Row IDs

Each dataset receives stable row identifiers.

Example:

```python
course_df["row_id"] = [
    f"course_{i}" for i in range(len(course_df))
]
```

This enables:

* reproducible evaluation
* row-level comparison
* disagreement analysis

---

## 5. Input Formatting

Input text is formatted as:

```text
[DOMAIN] ... [ASPECT] ... [TEXT] ...
```

Example:

```python
def format_input(row):

    return (
        "[DOMAIN] " + row["domain"] +
        " [ASPECT] " + row["aspect"] +
        " [TEXT] " + row["review"]
    )
```

---

## 6. Label Mapping

Sentiment labels are mapped:

| Sentiment | Label |
| --------- | ----- |
| negative  | 0     |
| neutral   | 1     |
| positive  | 2     |

---

## 7. Shared Test Set Creation

Each domain is split independently using stratified splitting.

Example:

```python
course_train, course_test = train_test_split(
    course_df,
    test_size=0.2,
    stratify=course_df["label"],
    random_state=42
)
```

The resulting test sets are saved:

```python
teacher_test.to_csv(...)
course_test.to_csv(...)
university_test.to_csv(...)
```

These shared test sets are reused across:

* multidomain experiments
* cross-domain experiments

This ensures:

* aligned evaluation
* consistent row_ids
* fair comparison

---

## 8. Multidomain Training Setup

Training data:

```python
train_df = pd.concat([
    course_train,
    teacher_train,
    university_train
])
```

Validation split:

```python
train_df, val_df = train_test_split(
    train_df,
    test_size=0.1,
    stratify=train_df["label"],
    random_state=42
)
```

---

## 9. HuggingFace Dataset Conversion

Example:

```python
train_dataset = Dataset.from_pandas(
    train_df[["input_text", "label"]]
)
```

---

## 10. Tokenization

Example:

```python
def tokenize_function(examples):

    return tokenizer(
        examples["input_text"],
        padding="max_length",
        truncation=True,
        max_length=128
    )
```

---

## 11. Weighted Loss

Class imbalance is handled using weighted cross-entropy loss.

Weights are computed using:

```python
compute_class_weight()
```

Custom trainer:

```python
class WeightedTrainer(Trainer):
```

---

| ---------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Multidomain Correct / Cross-domain Wrong | 181   |
| Cross-domain Correct / Multidomain Wrong | 89    |

---

### Neutral Sentiment Was Most Difficult

Frequent confusion:

* neutral vs negative
* neutral vs positive
* mixed polarity reviews
* conditional sentiment statements
